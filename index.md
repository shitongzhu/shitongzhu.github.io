## Research Interest

I'm broadly interested in computer security and web privacy. 
My past research focuses on **privacy-enhancing techniques**.
More specifically, I'm working on improving the effectiveness of adblocking by (i) analyzing the escalating arms race between adblockers and anti-adblockers; (ii) making adblockers stealthy against anti-adblockers via browser modifications; and (iii) leveraging machine learning to better identify advertising- and tracking-related resources.

Recently, I've also started to explore Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its applications in security and privacy research.
